Nonmonotonic bridge rules are used to specify the information flow among contexts. We investigate several notions of equilibrium representing acceptable
    belief states for our multi-context systems. The approach generalizes the heterogeneous monotonic multi-context systems developed by F. Giunchiglia and colleagues as well as the homogeneous nonmonotonic multi-context systems of Brewka, Serafini and Roelofsen.},

    Abstract = {In this paper we introduce a multi-context variant of Reiter's default logic. The logic provides a syntactical counterpart of Roelofsen and Serafini's information chain approach (IJCAI-05), yet has several advantages: it is closer to standard ways of representing nonmonotonic inference and a number of results from that area come for free; it is closer to implementation, in particular the restriction to logic programming gives us a computationally attractive framework; and it allows us to handle a problem with the information chain approach related to skeptical reasoning.},

                  powerful generalization of Dung's argumentation
                  frameworks ({\sc af}s). In particular, we show how
                  the existing definitions of stable and preferred
                  semantics which are restricted to the subcase of
                  so-called bipolar {\sc adf}s can be improved and
                  generalized to arbitrary frameworks. Furthermore, we
                  introduce preference handling methods for {\sc
                  adf}s, allowing for both reasoning with and about
                  preferences. Finally, we present an implementation
                  based on an encoding in answer set programming.},

  abstract =	 {Over the last two decades the interest for Abstract
                  Argumentationsteadily raised in the field of
                  Artificial Intelligence. The concept of Dung's
                  Argumentation Frameworks (AFs), where arguments and
                  their relations are represented in a directed
                  graph-structure, is a well-known, simple, and
                  powerful concept. This framework is used to find
                  acceptable sets of arguments, which have specific
                  properties (e.g. being conflict free), defined by
                  several semantics. Recently Abstract Dialectical
                  Frameworks (ADFs) were introduced, a generalization
                  of Dung's approach, to overcome the limitation of
                  attack-relations being the only type of native
                  relations. To reach this goal, in addition to the
                  relations, total functions are used to decide the
                  acceptance of an argument.  These functions are so
                  called acceptance conditions. Due to the high
                  expressiveness of this newly proposed theory, some
                  semantics were only generalized for the restricted
                  bipolar ADFs yet. This work will give an exhaustive
                  overview on ADFs. The restriction to bipolar ADFs
                  for some of the semantics is not desired, so we try
                  to develop a solution to gain the generalized stable
                  model semantics. This semantics is particularly
                  important because the other semantics which are
                  restricted to bipolar ADFs, depend on stable
                  models. To gain such a generalization, we will try
                  to connect the foundations of ADFs to other fields
                  of computer science. So we may relate subclasses of
                  these fields to the bipolar ADF to overcome this
                  obstacle. This connection also makes ADFs more
                  accessible to other fields of computer science. We
                  will concentrate mainly on the introduction of the
                  alternative representation of propositional-formula
                  ADFs (pForm-ADFs), but we will also show that ADFs
                  can be represented as hyper-graphs. Based on the new
                  representation a transformation from ADFs to
                  pForm-ADFs, together with a generalization of the
                  stable model semantics will be presented. In
                  addition some properties between semantics will be
                  investigated and an overview of complexity results,
                  enriched with new ones is given. Currently there is
                  no software system available to compute semantics
                  for ADFs.  So in addition to the formal results we
                  also present an Answer Set Programming (ASP) based
                  implementation to solve these highly complex
                  computations. We will also present preliminary
                  empirical experiments.},

                  in order to do some reasoning about the given
                  information.  During the last decades many different
                  KR-languages were proposed for a variety of certain
                  applications with specific needs.  The concept of a
                  managed Multi-Context System (mMCS) was introduced
                  to provide adequate formal tools to interchange and
                  integrate knowledge between different KR-approaches.
                  Another arising field of interest in computer
                  science is the design of online applications, which
                  react directly to (possibly infinite) streams of
                  information.  This paper presents a genuine approach
                  to generalize mMCS for online applications with
                  continuous streams of information.  Our major goal
                  is to find a good tradeoff between expressiveness
                  and computational complexity.}
