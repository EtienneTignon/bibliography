                  repertoire of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii under reference
                  conditions. Bioinformatics annotation methods combined with
                  GCxGC/MS-based metabolomics and LC/MS-based shotgun
                  proteomics profiling technologies have been applied to
                  characterize abundant proteins and metabolites, resulting in
                  the detection of 1069 proteins and 159 metabolites. Of the
                  measured proteins, 204 currently do not have EST sequence
                  support; thus a significant portion of the
                  proteomics-detected proteins provide evidence for the
                  validity of in silico gene models. Furthermore, the
                  generated peptide data lend support to the validity of a
                  number of proteins currently in the proposed model stage. By
                  integrating genomic annotation information with
                  experimentally identified metabolites and proteins, we
                  constructed a draft metabolic network for
                  Chlamydomonas. Computational metabolic modeling allowed an
                  identification of missing enzymatic links. Some
                  experimentally detected metabolites are not producible by
                  the currently known and annotated enzyme set, thus
                  suggesting entry points for further targeted gene discovery
                  or biochemical pathway research. All data sets are made
                  available as supplementary material as well as

                  via the Chlamydomonas-adapted MapMan annotation

                  content expressed in the Systems Biology Markup Language
                  (SBML) format. It is written in ISO C and C++, provides
                  language bindings for Common Lisp, Java, Python, Perl,
                  MATLAB and Octave, and includes many features that
                  facilitate adoption and use of both SBML and the
                  li-brary. Developers can embed libSBML in their

                  capacities of metabolic networks. The implementation is
                  based on the network expansion algorithm and the concept of
                  scopes. For a given network and predefined external
                  resources, called the seed metabolites, the scope is defined
                  as the set of products which the network is in principle
                  able to produce. Through the web interface the user can
                  select a variety of metabolic networks or provide his or her
                  own list of reactions. The information on the
                  organism-specific networks has been extracted from the KEGG
                  database. By choosing an arbitrary set of seed compounds,
                  the user can obtain the corresponding scopes. With our web
                  server application we provide an easy to use interface to
                  perform a variety of structural and functional network
                  analyses. Problems that can be addressed using the web

                  the visualization of synthesis pathways, functional analysis

  abstract =	 {A fully compartmentalized genome-scale metabolic model of
                  Saccharomyces cerevisiae that accounts for 750 genes and
                  their associated transcripts, proteins, and reactions has
                  been reconstructed and validated.  All of the 1149 reactions
                  included in this in silico model are both elementally and
                  charge balanced and have been assigned to one of eight
                  cellular locations (extracellular space, cytosol,
                  mitochondrion, peroxisome, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum,
                  Golgi apparatus, or vacuole). When in silico predictions of
                  4154 growth phenotypes were compared to two published
                  large-scale gene deletion studies, an 83\% agreement was
                  found between iND750's predictions and the experimental
                  studies.  Analysis of the failure modes showed that false
                  predictions were primarily caused by iND750's limited
                  inclusion of cellular processes outside of metabolism. This
                  study systematically identified inconsistencies in our
                  knowledge of yeast metabolism that require specific further
                  experimental investigation.},

  abstract =	 {Reactome, located at http://www.reactome.org is a curated,
                  peer-reviewed resource of human biological processes. Given
                  the genetic makeup of an organism, the complete set of
                  possible reactions constitutes its reactome. The basic unit
                  of the Reactome database is a reaction; reactions are then
                  grouped into causal chains to form pathways. The Reactome
                  data model allows us to represent many diverse processes in
                  the human system, including the pathways of intermediary
                  metabolism, regulatory pathways, and signal transduction,
                  and high-level processes, such as the cell cycle. Reactome
                  provides a qualitative framework, on which quantitative data
                  can be superimposed. Tools have been developed to facilitate
                  custom data entry and annotation by expert biologists, and
                  to allow visualization and exploration of the finished
                  dataset as an interactive process map. Although our primary
                  curational domain is pathways from Homo sapiens, we
                  regularly create electronic projections of human pathways
                  onto other organisms via putative orthologs, thus making
                  Reactome relevant to model organism research
                  communities. The database is publicly available under open
                  source terms, which allows both its content and its software

                  Early Conflict Detection Based BCP (ECDB); and a modified
                  decision heuristic based on the combination of Variable
                  State Independent Decaying Sum (VSIDS), Berkmin, and Sieges
                  Variable Move to Front (VMTF). These features were
                  implemented and compared within the framework of the MIRA
                  SAT solver. The efficient implementation and analysis of
                  these features are presented and the speedup and robustness
                  each feature provides is demonstrated. Finally, with
                  everything enabled (ECDB with IQS and advanced decision
                  heuristics), MIRA was able to consistently outperform zChaff
                  and even Forklift on the benchmarks provided, solving 37 out
                  of 111 industrial benchmarks compared to zChaffs 21 and

@article{thavlucba08,
  abstract =	 {Background:\&\#10;Oxidative stress is a common stress
                  encountered by living organisms and is due to an imbalance
                  between intracellular reactive oxygen and nitrogen species
                  (ROS, RNS) and cellular antioxidant defence. To defend
                  themselves against ROS/RNS, bacteria possess a subsystem of
                  detoxification enzymes, which are classified with regard to
                  their substrates. To identify such enzymes in prokaryotic
                  genomes, different approaches based on similarity, enzyme
                  profiles or patterns exist. Unfortunately, several problems
                  persist in the annotation, classification and naming of
                  these enzymes due mainly to some erroneous entries in
                  databases, mistake propagation, absence of updating and
                  disparity in function description. \&\#10;Description: In
                  order to improve the current annotation of oxidative stress
                  subsystems, an innovative platform named OxyGene has been
                  developed. It integrates an original database called OxyDB,
                  holding thoroughly tested anchor-based signatures associated
                  to subfamilies of oxidative stress enzymes, and a new
                  anchor-driven annotator, for ab initio detection of ROS/RNS
                  response genes. All complete Bacterial and Archaeal genomes
                  have been re-annotated, and the results stored in the
                  OxyGene repository can be interrogated via a Graphical User
                  Interface.\&\#10;Conclusion:\&\#10;OxyGene enables the
                  exploration and comparative analysis of enzymes belonging to
                  37 detoxification subclasses in 664 microbial genomes. It
                  proposes a new classification that improves both the
                  ontology and the annotation of the detoxification subsystems
                  in prokaryotic whole genomes, while discovering new ORFs and
                  attributing precise function to hypothetical annotated
                  proteins. OxyGene is freely available at:\&\#10;
